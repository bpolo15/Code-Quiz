# Code-Quiz

link:https://bpolo15.github.io/Code-Quiz/

Goal for this activity:

The main goal was to create an interactive quiz which could be played on your computer.

The user experience:
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

Areas to be changed/improved:
The style of the page and text is still in progress.
More questions will be added.
The high scores will be saved to be viewed by clicking on the "high scores" link in the top left corner.
